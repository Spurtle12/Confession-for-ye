    <div class="scroll">Hi Loviee, thank you for responding to my message. I'm happy that we get to talk again. And... as you already know how I feel about you from the previous page, I want to fully express it here. Loviee, I like you. I've liked you for a long time, since the beginning. It's not because of how you look nor your voice, but because of the wisdom you hold. I know you already like someone, but I still want to confess my feelings, and I wanted to express it this way. One more thing: most of the people on the Discord server knows about this. I mean, they know how I feel about you, especially Wally and Cessi. I had planned to send this on February 14th, but I didn't send it because we weren't talking then, and nahihiya rin ako. Plus, I didn't know how to publish it. that's all. thanks for reading this. byeee!
